# MNIST-Classification-Keras

A simple, exploratory study on the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with Keras framework (Tensorflow background) for a simple handwritten number image classification task. This project was primarily made with the purpose of learning and getting familiar with Multi-layered Perceptrons, training and performance testing in Keras framework, which efficiently streamlines its implementation with intuitive, simple-to-use functional APIs. This eliminates the need of managing computational graphs in Tensorflow and allows us to easily play with the Neural Network Architecture.

## Dataset 

We have used the renowned [MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) containing 60,000 train samples and 10,000 test samples of 28x28 grayscale images depicting numerical digits written by a huge number of human subjects.
